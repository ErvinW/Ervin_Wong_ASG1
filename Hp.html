                        The Xbox Series X/S headset's thick padding on the headband and earcups provide maximum comfort for long gaming sessions, while its mic
                        is able to capture users' voices clearly over calls and voice chat. The built-in mic cannot be retracted, but can be folded around the
                        earcup and can be turned on and off via a swtich on the side of the headset. Audio volume can be adjusted via a dial on the right
                        earcup. Despite some minor flaws such as the headset being not so breathable, it makes for a good gaming headset at a low price
